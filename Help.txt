Our business problem is the charging scheduling problem, which is caused by the fact that a company working with a limited number of equipment completes its daily tasks with electric vehicles. With our solution, we aim to maximize the number of completed tasks by assigning the tools to the appropriate tasks in the optimal way. We aim to produce a more feasible solution to this problem with the code we wrote while carrying out this project. Our value propositions are that employees can complete their assigned tasks with minimal disruption, and that vehicles are charged at the start of the shift.
